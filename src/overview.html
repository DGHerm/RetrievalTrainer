This piece of software is for educational purposes, more precisely may be useful
for information retrieval learning and in preparing for assessment tests.
I named it <em>JavaExercises</em>, as a working title, because the work on this
software was part of my preparation of the Oracle certification exam <em>Java SE 8 Programmer I</em>.
But this software is useful for other topics as well, so I changed the title to <strong>RetrievalTrainer</strong>.
<p>
To the student the subject matter is presented in ways of flashcards:
Each exercise item is composed of a question part and an answer part.
<p>
The flashcard concept is modified here, with the objective of a measurable
learning progress:
The answer part is splitted into a list of prepared answers, suggested to the student.
But the correct answer is disguised in a set of wrong answers, to puzzle the student.
An exercise item counts as correct answered, if by <em>single choice</em> the hidden correct
answer is selected.
<p>
Exercise items may also be prepared to require the student to make
a <em>multiple choice</em> of correct answers. Such exercise items counts as correct
answered only if all of the hidden correct answers have been selected.
<p>
An exercise item ends with a solution part, which facilitates the learning: The memory is
trained by <strong>first</strong> activating the concentration on some problem during
a brief span of time, and <strong>second</strong> shortly afterwards presenting the correct
solution, to force a dissonant effect in the brain, or provoking an aha-experience.
<p>
Of course, the solution part is by default hidden to the student, but can be shown
on demand. In case the solution is exposed, the choice out of the given answers is no more alterable
by the student.
